# 4_Rth_year_Hns_project
This GPU driven simulation is capable of rendering nearly than 3 million Boids at more than 55 FPS. After studying and observing the simulation, it can be concluded that the leader following behavior, when added to the Boids algorithm, coupled with the obstacle avoiding ability might prove very useful for drones in search and rescue operation at sea and can help save lives
Outline of Project:
This project aims to explore and implement Craig Reynold’s Boids program to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds in graphical context by leveraging the GPU’s processing power and Nvidia’s CUDA programming model.
In the past Boids program and algorithms have been used for the purpose of achieving visually stunning and scientifically accurate flock simulations in animation, movies and some Video-games.
My project aims to explore further application of Boids behavioural model in context of unmanned aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones for emergencies; and search and rescue purposes. The idea is to simulate a flock of drones, programmed to abide the basic rules of separation, alignment and cohesion, incorporating an additional appropriate behaviour to meet the requirement of a demonstrable use scenario:
▪ Obstacle avoidance
▪ Add more Boids during run time
▪ Goal Seeking or fly to a point of interest, can be used for emergency medicine
drop off in remote or rural areas.
▪ Fly away from an on-pursuit predator
