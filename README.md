This GPU driven simulation is capable of rendering nearly than 3 million Boids at more than 55 FPS. After studying and observing the simulation, it can be concluded that the leader following behavior, when added to the Boids algorithm, coupled with the obstacle avoiding ability might prove very useful for drones in search and rescue operation at sea and can help save lives
